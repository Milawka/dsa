Write a Java programthat can simulate a simple calculator, using the Java console
as the exclusive input and output device. That is, each input to the calculator, be
it a number, like 12.34 or 1034, or an operator, like + or =, can be done on a
separate line. After each such input, you should output to the Java console what
would be displayed on your calculator
